The test file for urban backend is \"intersection_backend.py\". Open CARLA simulator and run python intersection_backend.py to verify the backend has been successfully installed. Note: the first time you run the code, the following error may occur: RuntimeError: time-out of 10000ms while waiting for the simulator, make sure the simulator is ready and connected to localhost:2000 UnboundLocalError: local variable 'env' referenced before assignment This is because the carla client failed to connect to the carla server.
